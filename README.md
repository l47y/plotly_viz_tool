This is a small Shiny app (still under development) to quickly produce visualizations of a dataset. It is inspired by the very useful [esquisse](/https://github.com/dreamRs/esquisse/) package but uses plotly in the backend. 

To run the app use:

```r
shiny::runGitHub("plotly_viz_tool", "l47y")
```
